        "# Social Media Habits, Productivity Loss, and Brain Rot\n",

        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:** Social media has been known to affect a person’s productivity, phrases like boom scrolling and brain rot have been introduced to describe endless scrolling on social media. In this project, I will analyze how social media usage affects both productivity and brain rot. Using two dataset, a brain rot questionnaire labeled yes/no and a ‘Time-Wasters on Social Media’ dataset, I will study how patterns in social media behavior, self-control, and addiction relate to reduced productivity, difficulty concentrating, and negative moods. My goal is to identify which specific usage patterns and demographic factors are most strongly associated with ‘boom scrolling’ on social media and experiencing brain rot style outcomes.\n"

However, across all three clusters, the average productivity loss stayed around 5, and the share of users flagged as high productivity loss (about 46–51%) and high addiction (about 29–33%) was almost the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "-The gender breakdown was also very similar in every cluster. These results suggest that demographic differences alone don’t really separate high-risk from low-risk users in this dataset. This lines up with my earlier findings: psychological factors like self-control, satisfaction, and addiction level, along with when people are online, are much more important for identifying who is actually at risk than demographics by themselves."

        "To conclude, this project analyzes my idea of “brain rot” and productivity loss back to the actual data. Using the Brain Rot survey, I was able to build a classifier that almost perfectly separated people with and without the brain-rot pattern defined. The most important signals were not random: spending more hours on social media, longer overall screen time, feeling worse after using technology, and reporting low focus all lined up with the brain-rot label.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the Time-Wasters dataset, the regression and classification models told a similar story. The productivity loss was predicted almost perfectly from just a few self-reported factors being satisfaction with social media, addiction level, and self-control. When I turned the problem into a high-risk classification, the models for high productivity loss and high addiction both reached very high accuracy, and again the main drivers were self-control, satisfaction, addiction level, and late night usage, not just the time spent. The clustering results reinforced this with behavior and psych based clusters clearly separated the different types of users, while demographic clusters (age, income, debt, gender) showed very similar risk levels across groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, these results support my original idea that “brain rot” and productivity loss are less about who you are and more about how you use social media and how in control you feel. Heavy usage combined with low self-control, low satisfaction, and late night scrolling is what really shows up as risky in the models, which suggests that interventions should probably focus on habits and self-regulation rather than just telling people to look at their screen time total."
